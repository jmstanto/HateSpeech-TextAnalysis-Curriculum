Psychology students usually take course work on topics like experimental design and inferential statistics, but training on computer-aided analysis of text is less common. Thus, for students to understand the variable nature of online hate speech, instructional support for basic forms of text analysis will enable psychology faculty members to include real data and analytical examples in their course offerings. Thus, this repository contains the following materials:<p>
